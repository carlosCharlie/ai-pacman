      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
          This is a modification of <a href="https://github.com/daleharvey/pacman">the pac-man game developed by daleharvey</a> to which I have added an <a href="https://github.com/carlosCharlie/ai-pacman/blob/master/ia/ia.js">artificial intelligence</a> that learns to play by looking at the user's movements, using a <a href="https://github.com/mljs/decision-tree-cart">ml.js library decision tree</a>.
          The more you play, the better the ai plays.
      </p>
      <h2>How to try it?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Click on "Play" button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Play the game with your keyboard arrows keys. (For a good result, try to cover all the map running from ghosts).
        </li>
        <li>
          Click "Start AI".
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      You can play again and the ai will keep learning.
      <br>
      <u>Reloading the page will empty the saved data!</u>
      <br>
      Remember that the ai uses only the data of the current game, so it will surely be very dumb.
